> - Please include both brief and detailed answers.
> - The report should be based on the UCX code.
> - Describe the code using the 'permalink' from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab).

## 1. Overview
> In conjunction with the UCP architecture mentioned in the lecture, please read [ucp_hello_world.c](https://github.com/NTHU-LSALAB/UCX-lsalab/blob/pp2024/examples/ucp_hello_world.c)
1. Identify how UCP Objects (`ucp_context`, `ucp_worker`, `ucp_ep`) interact through the API, including at least the following functions:
    - `ucp_config`
        holds configuration settings for initializing UCX's application context (ucp_context)
    - `ucp_ep`
        represents a communication channel between two workers, used for sending and receiving messages
    - `ucp_context` 
        used for managing global resources such as memory, transport, and communication protocols.

    First, ```ucp_config_read()``` reads system and environment variables or a config file to set the transport,   performance and context parameters. Then,    ```ucp_init()``` uses the provided parameters and configuration (***ucp_context*** and ***ucp_params***) to allocate system resources, initialize memory pools, and set up transport layers.

    In the provided code, setting ***UCP_WORKER_PARAM_FIELD_THREAD_MODE*** in worker_params ensures that ```ucp_worker_create``` uses the single-thread mode (***UCS_THREAD_MODE_SINGLE***), which eliminates the need for locking mechanisms. It initializes a UCP worker, enabling message-passing and data communication between nodes in a distributed system. To retrieve more information about the worker, ```ucp_worker_query()``` is used with the field ***UCP_WORKER_ATTR_FIELD_ADDRESS***, allowing the query of the worker's address.

    After obtaining the necessary information, the server and client need to establish a connection through Out-of-Band (OOB) communication. 

    ## client

    Use ```connect_common()``` to establishe a TCP/IP socket connection to the server. Receives the server's UCP worker address length (***peer_addr_len***). Allocates memory for the address. Retrieves the UCP worker address through the socket. 
    
    Then call ```run_ucx_client()``` : 
    1. Create a UCP endpoint (***ucp_ep***) using ```ucp_ep_create()``` with the received address, enabling efficient data communication.
    2. Sends the message (client’s UCP address) using ***ucp_tag_send_nbx*** to server. Waits for send completion using ***ucx_wait***.
    3. Probes for incoming data from the server using ***ucp_tag_probe_nb***. If no message is found, advances ```ucp_worker_progress()``` engine. If no progress occurs, uses blocking polling mechanisms (***ucp_worker_wait***).
    4. Configures ***recv_param*** for the receive operation. Receives the message using ***ucp_tag_msg_recv_nbx***. Waits for completion using ***ucx_wait***.
    5. Frees all allocated memory. Closes the UCP endpoint (***server_ep***).

    ## server

    Use ```connect_common()``` to establishe a TCP/IP socket connection to the clinet. Sends the server's UCP worker address length. Sends the UCP worker address through the socket.

    1. The server waits for the client’s UCX address using non-blocking message probing (***ucp_tag_probe_nb***). It repeatedly calls ```ucp_worker_progress()``` to check for incoming messages until a valid message tag is detected.
    2. Calls ```ucp_tag_msg_recv_nbx()``` to receive the client’s address. Waits for the message transfer to complete using ```ucx_wait()```.
    3. Extracts the client’s address from the received message. Frees the previously allocated message buffer.
    4. Initializes a UCP endpoint with the client’s address using ```ucp_ep_create()```.
    5. Sends the test message using ***ucp_tag_send_nbx***. Waits for the send operation to complete using ```ucx_wait()```.
    6. Calls ```flush_ep``` to ensure all communication operations are completed.

2. UCX abstracts communication into three layers as below. Please provide a diagram illustrating the architectural design of UCX.
    - `ucp_context`
    - `ucp_worker`
    - `ucp_ep`

> Please provide detailed example information in the diagram corresponding to the execution of the command `srun -N 2 ./send_recv.out` or `mpiucx --host HostA:1,HostB:1 ./send_recv.out`

![the architectural design of UCX](https://github.com/109062227/Parallel-Programming/blob/main/hw5/two_new.jpg?raw=true)

3. Based on the description in HW5, where do you think the following information is loaded/created?
    - `UCX_TLS`

        The `UCX_TLS` specifies which communication transports (or "transport layers") UCX should use, so I think it might loaded in the `ucp_context.c`, or related to `ucp_context`.

    - TLS selected by UCX
        
        I think TLS selected by UCX is determined during the `ucp_ep_create()`, specifically when choosing lanes. 


## 2. Implementation
> Please complete the implementation according to the [spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fmm0TFpLxbDP7neNcbLDn8nhZpqUBi9NGRzWjgxZaPE/edit?usp=sharing)
> Describe how you implemented the two special features of HW5.
1. Which files did you modify, and where did you choose to print Line 1 and Line 2?

    - `ucp/core/ucp_worker.c - ucp_worker_print_used_tls()`
        
        In this function, the output from line 2 is stored in a string buffer `stdb`, while line 1 can be directly printed by calling `ucp_config_print()`. Therefore, I added two lines to this function: the first invokes `ucp_config_print()` to display line 1, and the second prints the contents of `strb` as line 2.

        ```c

        ucp_config_print(NULL,stdout,NULL,UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS);
        fprintf(stdout, "%s\n", ucs_string_buffer_cstr(&strb));

        ```
    
    - `ucs/config/parser.c - ucs_config_parser_print_opts()`

        This function is called by ***ucp_config_print()*** -> ***ucp_context.c/ucs_config_parser_print_opts()*** -> ***ucp_parser.c/ucs_config_parser_print_opts()***.

        I reference ***ucs_config_parser_print_env_vars()***, and add a loop to iterate through enviornment variables, find ***UCX_TLS*** then print it out.
        These are line 1.
        ```c

        // TODO: PP-HW-UCX
        if (flags & UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS) {
            char **en;
            for (en = environ; *en != NULL; ++en) 
            {
                if(strncmp(*en, "UCX_TLS", 7) == 0) 
                {
                    fprintf(stream, "%s\n", *en);
                }
            }

        }

        ```

    - `ucs/config/type.h`

        Need to define ***UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS*** as new types of Configuration printing flags in type.h.

        ```c

        typedef enum {
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_CONFIG          = UCS_BIT(0),
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_HEADER          = UCS_BIT(1),
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_DOC             = UCS_BIT(2),
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_HIDDEN          = UCS_BIT(3),
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_COMMENT_DEFAULT = UCS_BIT(4), 
            UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS = UCS_BIT(5)
        } ucs_config_print_flags_t;

        ```

2. How do the functions in these files call each other? Why is it designed this way?
    - line 1
        
        `ucp_worker_print_used_tls()` -> `ucp_config_print()` -> `ucs_config_parser_print_opts()` -> `ucs_config_parser_print_env_vars()`.

        Since ***environ*** represents all environment variables, I can find ***UCX_TLS*** then print it out.

    - line2

        `ucp_ep_create()`->`ucp_ep_create_to_sock_addr()`->`ucp_ep_init_create_wireup()`->`ucp_worker_get_ep_config()`->`ucp_worker_print_used_tls()` -> `printf`

        Since ***strb*** stores the information for each transport layer, I need to print it out.

    The design allows the worker to offload configuration printing to the parser, leveraging modularity and specialization, ensuring to improve efficiency through parallelism.

3. Observe when Line 1 and 2 are printed during the call of which UCP API?

    They are printed during the call of `ucp_ep_create()`.

4. Does it match your expectations for questions **1-3**? Why?

    `TLS selected by UCX` matches while `UCX_TLS` doesn't match. Even though some global configurations ( settings like UCX_TLS come from global environment variables ) are used in ***ucp_context*** ( handles communication ), they are processed in UCS, a shared service layer for UCX. 

5. In implementing the features, we see variables like lanes, tl_rsc, tl_name, tl_device, bitmap, iface, etc., used to store different Layer's protocol information. Please explain what information each of them stores.

    -  lanes

        Represents communication paths or channels that are configured for a particular protocol or transport layer. Each "lane" corresponds to a transport resource (e.g., InfiniBand, TCP, etc.) and is used to send and receive messages.

    - tl_rsc
        
        Transport Layer Resource, refers to a specific hardware resource or transport capability available for use by UCX.

    - tl_name

        Transport Layer Name, an attribute in tl_rsc, describes transport name.

    - tl_device

        Transport Layer Device, specifies the physical or logical device associated with the transport.

    - bitmap

        Tracks the availability or selection of resources. ( ex. UCS_CONFIG_PRINT_TLS flag)

    - iface

        Interface, represents the communication interface initialized for a transport layer. It acts as an abstraction over the actual transport mechanism and provides a unified way to send, receive, and manage data transfer.

    Tracing path : `ucp_worker_create()` -> `ucp_worker_add_resource_ifaces()` -> `ucp_worker_iface_open()` & `ucp_worker_select_best_ifaces()`

## 3. Optimize System 
1. Below are the current configurations for OpenMPI and UCX in the system. Based on your learning, what methods can you use to optimize single-node performance by setting UCX environment variables?

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/opt/modulefiles/openmpi/ucx-pp:

module-whatis   {OpenMPI 4.1.6}
conflict        mpi
module          load ucx/1.15.0
prepend-path    PATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/bin
prepend-path    LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/lib
prepend-path    MANPATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/share/man
prepend-path    CPATH /opt/openmpi-4.1.6/include
setenv          UCX_TLS ud_verbs
setenv          UCX_NET_DEVICES ibp3s0:1
-------------------------------------------------------------------
```

1. Please use the following commands to test different data sizes for latency and bandwidth, to verify your ideas:
```bash
module load openmpi/ucx-pp
mpiucx -n 2 $HOME/UCX-lsalab/test/mpi/osu/pt2pt/osu_latency
mpiucx -n 2 $HOME/UCX-lsalab/test/mpi/osu/pt2pt/osu_bw
```
Currently UCX_TLS=ud_verbs, I set `UCX_TLS = all` so that all the available transports can be used, and the optimal one can be chosen.

2. Please create a chart to illustrate the impact of different parameter options on various data sizes and the effects of different testsuite.

    ![latency](https://github.com/109062227/Parallel-Programming/blob/main/hw5/latency.png?raw=true)

    ![bandwidth](https://github.com/109062227/Parallel-Programming/blob/main/hw5/bandwidth.png?raw=true)

3. Based on the chart, explain the impact of different TLS implementations and hypothesize the possible reasons (references required).

    For the same data size, `UCX_TLS=all` outperforms `UCX_TLS=ud_verbs` both in terms of latency, achieving lower latency, and in terms of bandwidth, achieving higher bandwidth. Hence the performance has been optimized.
    
    `UCX_TLS=all` will dynamically select the best transport layer based on the system's hardware and network conditions. For example, it may choose shared memory for local communication, which can outperform the RDMA-based `UCX_TLS=ud_verbs`.

    Reference : [Low-Latency Communication for Fast DBMS Using RDMA and Shared Memory](https://db.in.tum.de/~fent/papers/Low-Latency%20Communication%20for%20Fast%20DBMS%20Using%20RDMA%20and%20Shared%20Memory.pdf)


### Advanced Challenge: Multi-Node Testing

This challenge involves testing the performance across multiple nodes. You can accomplish this by utilizing the sbatch script provided below. The task includes creating tables and providing explanations based on your findings. Notably, Writing a comprehensive report on this exercise can earn you up to 5 additional points.

- For information on sbatch, refer to the documentation at [Slurm's sbatch page](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).
- To conduct multi-node testing, use the following command:
```
cd ~/UCX-lsalab/test/
sbatch run.batch
```

![multi_node_latency](https://github.com/109062227/Parallel-Programming/blob/main/hw5/multi_node_latency.png?raw=true)

![multi_node_bandwidth](https://github.com/109062227/Parallel-Programming/blob/main/hw5/multi_node_bandwidth.png?raw=true)

Both latency and bandwidth are nearly identical when using `UCX_TLS=all` and `UCX_TLS=ud_verbs` on multi-nodes with the same data size.

 When moving to a multi-node environment, the network becomes the limiting factor. UCX will likely prioritize network-based transport layers such as ud_verbs (which is optimized for RDMA), and performance differences between UCX_TLS=all and UCX_TLS=ud_verbs narrow because both will rely on network-based communication protocols, which may perform similarly depending on the network conditions.

## 4. Experience & Conclusion
1. What have you learned from this homework?

    I became more familiar with the UCX framework by examining the code and understanding how changes in configuration can impact a process's performance.

2. How long did you spend on the assignment?

    About 2 days.
